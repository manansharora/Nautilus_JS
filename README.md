# Nautilus_JS
Symphony Tech Project

This project works on node.js v14.18...so if you have any other version of node installed, remove it and install the specified one.

 

Then follow these step's :-

1) The obvious...Extract the downloaded file.

2) Delete node_modules and package_lock.json.

3) Run npm install. (Once completely installed you will get new node_modules folder and package_lock.json file.)

4) Run npm start (You should get to see the login page on port localhost 3000.)

 

5) Hoping everything went as mentioned, Click on the login button and you’ll get the dashboard.

 

As discussed in the previous meeting you are aware of what to do, These are just the steps of how to start

 

-> On side bar you’ll see two links molds and sixstepstudy, Create a new link name it is Calculators, the code for that is in src/components/common/sidebar-component.

 

->  Components folder contains all the main code of the project, so you can create a new folder named as calculators like I have created sixstepstudy and keep all the files that you’ll create inside it without disturbing the other code.

 

-> The routes for all the pages are given in index.js file which is in src folder, Create new page for calculator give route in index.js file.

 

-> So the flow will be, after creating Calculators link in sidebar as you click on it you’ll get redirected to that page the one which you will create.
